# PHP Filesystem Management Tool
https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpfm/

phpFileManager is a complete filesystem management tool on a single file.
This is a tool meant for rapid file access, and also to verify the server php configuration and security.

The script contains a great serie of special functions and classes, that can be used on other projects.
Some were collected and improved, other developed by myself along the years.
There is no doubt, that any PHP developer will find something very useful among them.
This project is my own way to give feedback, for everything that the open source community is about.

## Is it secure?
Short answer. YES! phpFileManager is secure, but you must set a password on it.
The script can be renamed and deployed on an unique known url, that helps you keep it hidden.
But you have to set a password! Obviously!
If you do not, this script will allow any person to access it, that is the default setting.
And that is why i provide this script, with the following disclaimer.
